## JS

### Importing / Exporting

First lets make a function: 
```JavaScript
function combine(first, second) {
  return `${first}, ${second}`;
}

// now we will export it 

export { combine } 

```
importing

```JavaScript
import { combine } from 'filePath' // filePath is the filepath
```

### Libs

#### React

React is a front-end lib that is very popular!

To get started with it you will first need node installed [click here to do so](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then run `npm i create-react-app -g`, this will let you start making React apps.

to make one run `create-react-app nameapp` "nameapp" should be replaced with the name of your app (caps not allowed)!
